# README Generator

## Description

I built this app to streamline making a README file for new projects that I work on. With this app I can respond to prompts in the CLI and get a polished README for my project. I learned how to create a .gitignore file and add files to be ignored, and solved a problem with diverged branches in github.

## Installation

You will need Node.js to run this app. Once you have cloned the github repo to your machine navigate to the directory in the CLI and install dependencies with ```npm i```.

## Usage

Once you have the dependencies installed, remain in the directory that contains the index.js file and run it with ```node index.js``` in the CLI. Respond to the prompts with the correct information and a professional polished README.md file will be created in the README folder.
